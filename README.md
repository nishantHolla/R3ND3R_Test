# 📋 Project Description

RenderTest automates the rendering, previewing, and testing of React components to reduce manual testing effort and ensure real-time updates. It provides a live dashboard where developers can visualize component states and interactions. By automating test case generation for events like clicks, form validation, and modals, RenderTest ensures all UI components are tested efficiently, minimizing bugs and regressions.
